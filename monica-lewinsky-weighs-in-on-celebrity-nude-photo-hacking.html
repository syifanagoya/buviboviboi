She understands the humiliation of intimate moments being shared with strangers.</p><p>“Like so many others, I feel outrage — as a fellow victim, as a civilized individual, and as a woman — when other women are so easily and publicly violated.”</p><h4><a href=#>George W. adorably teaches Bill Clinton about being a granddad</a> >></h4><p>The reluctant tabloid star scolded those who blame victims for taking the nude photos in the first place.</p><p>She chided, “It is immaterial that the recently purloined photos revealed under-dressed celebrities. And, yet, being human we often find ourselves torn between our own right to privacy and our dissolute desires as voyeurs and gossips in an image-and trivia-fueled culture. How much we indulge our inquiring minds is an individual choice. But certainly we can agree that stolen private nudes of actresses (or of anyone, really) is crossing the double yellow line.”</p><p>Some of the affected celebrities in the hacking included Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Miranda Cosgrove and an underage McKayla Maroney. The FBI is now investigating the source of the hacking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoaWBqfXmAlGikqKaZmK5uuMSwoKerm656uLHIoJ%2BsZZmjerC6jJycpZ2Sp7a1xYynrJ2dXaW1sMDOZp%2Bam5ueu6h7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-altmans-wife-heather-bilyeu-is-pregnant-w439300.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Altmans Wife Heather Bilyeu Is Pregnant</span></a>
