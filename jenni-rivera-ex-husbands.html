She became pregnant at 15 with daughter Chiquis Rivera, to whom she gave birth in 1985, and went on to marry her baby daddy, José Trinidad Marín, aka Trino.</p><p>Trino and Jenni went on to have two more kids: Jacqueline and Michael.</p><p>After eight years of marriage, Jenni and Trino split up in 1992 when Jenni found out that Trino was sexually abusing her younger sister, Rosie Rivera, and their daughter, Chiquis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jenni also revealed that she was a victim of domestic abuse during her first marriage, and pressed charges against Trino. A molestation case was opened in 1997, but Jenni's first husband wasn't apprehended until 2006 after nine years of running from the law.</p><p>In 2007, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison without parole for sexually abusing Rosie, Chiquis, and his youngest daughter, Jacqui.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Jenni Rivera divorce Juan Lopez?</h2><p>Juan López and Jenni married in 1997, two years after they met in LA.

It turns out that Jenni suffered a great deal due to Juan's infidelities, which she details in her autobiography Unbreakable: My Story, My Way, on which Mariposa de Barrio is based.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Juan was also selling drugs around the time of their divorce, which was apparently the official reason for which Jenni ended the marriage in 2003. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> writes that Jenni had known about Juan's drug dealing long before they hit rocky grounds, but "notified the authorities only when she found him cheating on her" with a different woman.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenni's third marriage lasted only a couple of years.</h2><p>In 2010, Jenni married her third husband, baseball player Esteban Loaiza, not to be confused with <a href=#>the love of Jenni's life, singer Fernando "Fernie" Ramirez</a>, who she affectionately called "El Pelón."</p><p>Jenni and Esteban were in the middle of their divorce proceedings when the star died in a plane crash, apparently because of a misunderstanding that led the "De Contrabando" singer to believe that her daughter Chiquis and her husband had become romantically involved.</p><p>"The world and my family lost Jenni on December 9," Chiquis said in a 2013 interview with Azteca América, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mamas Latinas</a>. "I lost my mother two months before on October 2. It was a misunderstanding. My world ended on that day. Every day I have to live with this, no one knows the pain I carry, especially because it was a misunderstanding, there were so many people in the middle that caused so much pain, so many problems that it was impossible not to be upset."</p><p>As for Jenni's true love and soulmate, Fernie, he's still making music today.</p><p>Stream Mariposa de Barrio on Netflix to learn more about Jenni and the many things that happened over the course of her short life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvushmqaKulaeubrHXZp%2Buq5KWu6W%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pat-boone-net-worth-how-rich-is-pat-boone.html><span>←</span><span>Pat Boone Net Worth: How rich is Pat Boone?</span></a>
