He is known by the nicknames “Greg the Leg” or “Legatron” among both his fans and teammates.&nbsp;He earned these nicknames due to his ability to convert long field goals.</span></p><p><span>Greg Zuerlein was a student at Lincoln Pius X Catholic High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and while there he played football and soccer and received letters in both.&nbsp;Additionally, he earned All-State and All-Class honors in his junior and senior years at Nebraska.</span></p><p><span>After graduating high school, Zürlein pursued his college football career at the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO).&nbsp;He played three seasons but sat out the 2010 season due to a hip injury.&nbsp;While playing for the Omaha Mavericks football team, the talented player amassed a school record of 61 straight extra points and converted 19 of 26 field goal attempts.</span></p><span>In 2011, the UN scrapped its football program and as a result, Greg transferred to Missouri Western State University for his final college football season with the Missouri Western Griffons football team.&nbsp;There he compiled an NCAA Division II record of 21 consecutive field goals (seven of which were 50-yard and two of which were 58-yard field goals).&nbsp;He also had a .952 field goal percentage after completing 23 of 24 attempts.&nbsp;This was the highest by any NCAA player in a division with 12 attempts or more in 2011.</span><p><span>The kicker entered the 2012 NFL Draft and was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the 6th round with a 171st overall pick.&nbsp;This made him the first non-bowl kicker in the Championship Series since 2006 and the first kicker below the Division I Football Bowl subdivision since 2005.</span></p><p><span>He started his professional career as setting a very high standard for himself, having broken and set multiple league and franchise records in his rookie season.&nbsp;In Week 3 of the 2015 season, he hit a 56-yard field goal, which is Soldier Field’s longest.</span></p><p><span>In the game against the Seattle Seahawks the following week, he beat his own record of 58 yards, which he previously set in the same game with a 60-yard field goal.&nbsp;In doing so, he broke Jeff Wilkins’ 14-year record and became the first player in NFL history to hit a 60-yard streak.&nbsp;yard field goal and an over 50 yarder in the same game.</span></p><p><span>Also that same season, Greg hit a 54-yard field goal in week 13 during the game against the San Francisco 49ers and it was the second-longest field goal scored in overtime since the NFL began.</span></p><p><span>He joined the Los Angeles Rams in 2016 on a one-year contract, and in 2017 the contract was extended to the next three years.&nbsp;He has maintained his strong performances with the Rams and was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Month on November 2, 2017.&nbsp;In December 2017, he was named to his first Pro Bowl.&nbsp;The player finished the 2017 season as the league’s top scorer with 158 points and 11.3 points per game.</span></p><p><span>The 2019 season was again spectacular for Greg Zuerlein.&nbsp;He was instrumental in the Rams’ multi-game NFC Championship Game win over the New Orleans Saints.&nbsp;During the game, he hit all four of his field goal attempts and paved the way for his team to participate in Super Bowl LIII.</span></p><h2><strong><span>salary</span></strong></h2><p><span>In 2017, the placekicker signed a 3-year contract extension with the Los Angles Rams.&nbsp;The deal includes a signing bonus of $750,000, a guaranteed bonus of $2,375,000 and an average annual salary of $2,250,000.&nbsp;Zürlein will receive a base salary of $2,325,000 and a signing bonus of $250,000 in 2019.&nbsp;Consequently, the NFL star is expected to bring home a cap hit of $2,575,000 and a dead cap of $250,000.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family, woman</span></strong></h2><p><span>Greg Zuerlein is married to Megan Lynn Zuerlein(nee Krefels).&nbsp;Megan was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA in 1989 and is the last of three children born to Terry and Barbara Krefels.&nbsp;Her older siblings are named Amanda and Justin.</span></p><p><span>She attended Lincoln Pius X Catholic High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and later transferred to Hastings College, where she worked as a goaltender for the girls’ soccer team.&nbsp;She was so good at sports that she won the 2011 Lincoln Journal Star Athlete of the Year.&nbsp;Megan later attended Creighton University, where she studied nursing.&nbsp;After graduating, she worked at St. Anthony’s Medical Center before going to Gateway Endoscopy Center.</span></p><p><span>Greg and his wife were high school sweethearts.&nbsp;They married on April 27, 2013 and are now blessed with four beautiful children.&nbsp;The first named Emma was born in 2014 while the second Morgan arrived on June 14, 2015.&nbsp;The couple welcomed their first son, named Greg Jr., in August 2016 and their second son, Samuel Gene, was born on November 12, 2018.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Greg Zuerlein will surely rank among the tallest players in the NFL as his height is quite impressive.&nbsp;The Nebraska-born athlete is measured to be 6 feet (183 cm) tall.&nbsp;The NFL star also maintains a body weight of 87 kg (191 lb), which is consistent with his height.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
