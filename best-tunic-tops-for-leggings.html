While any tunic (or top) can be worn with leggings, there is one key feature that makes some better than others, especially if you're headed somewhere a bit more formal like the office. For those more dressed-up environments, the best tunic tops for leggings will hit below the waist. These tops also come in all different sorts of styles and shapes.</p><h2>How To Style Tunic Tops</h2><p>Ahead, you'll find 23 stylish tunics that are perfect for <a href=# class=T3D>pairing with leggings</a>, but most of them will look great with jeans and denim cutoffs, too; some can even be worn as beach cover-ups or dresses. (Some styling tips: Try pairing the former with a <a href=# class=T3D>sun hat</a> and sandals, or dress up the latter with statement earrings and heels.) The beauty of the general tunic-and-legging combo is that it works with just about any type of footwear: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>chunky sandals</a> in the summer, sneakers for more casual occasions, and boots in the fall. And for those tunics that are extra-long and billowy, you can give them some shape by cinching them at the waist with a belt.</p><p>All of the best tunic tops featured ahead are available on Amazon Fashion, and most of them cost less than $30 (though you will find some luxury picks from brands like Free People and Vince for equal measure).

They come in lighter and heavier options. And the neckline, while keeping me very much covered, is so stretchy I can pull it down easily to unhook my bra and breastfeed my daughter!!”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">2</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">Another Simple, Lightweight Tunic For Year-Round Wear</h2></p><p>Another classic, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>menswear-inspired tunic</a> to add to your collection of basics, this lightweight top from Goodthreads is guaranteed to get so much wear.

Considering it costs about $20 and comes in over 20 colors/prints — including tie-dye, ombre, and florals — it's worth stocking up on more than one.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: S — XXL</li><li>Available colors/prints: 21</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “I have a longer torso and most tops are not never long enough.

It is a nice, soft cotton that launders and irons up easily.

The top is nicely modest, and not too tight over my 36” D bust. The arm holes are just enough to cover the bra straps and not too exposing.

It has a flowy hem that's longer in the back, and is made of a super soft, stretchy blend of spandex and rayon.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — 6X</li><li>Available colors/prints: 35</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “This is the shirt I’ve been waiting for! It’s stretchy, covers your bottom for when you’re wearing leggings, and the fabric hasn’t faded or warped after washing and drying: I’m a size 12 dress/pants and usually take tops in a large but the medium was perfect. Love the hi low style. Highly recommend!”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">7</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Sporty Tunic Sweatshirt With A Cool, Asymmetrical Zipper</h2></p><p>Sporty enough to wear for runs but stylish enough to wear to lunch with friends, this<a href=# rel=noreferrer> tunic pullover</a> has a cool cowl neck and asymmetrical zipper detail, which sets it apart from most other basic sweatshirts. 5% spandex in the fabric gives it a nice bit of stretch.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: S — XXL</li><li>Available colors/prints: 14</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “I love the way this top fits. It’s roomy enough that you don’t feel like it’s too clingy. You can put a tank under it and leave the zipper open and it’s long enough to wear with leggings. The material is just right so you aren’t too warm or too cold. I would definitely get more.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">8</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Sporty-Chic Tunic With Thumbholes & Zippered Pockets</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tunic-style sweatshirt</a> features thoughtful details that make it perfect for running, like a roomy, zippered front pocket, thumbholes for added warmth, and moisture-wicking fabric to keep you dry and fresh.

I normally wear a medium and this fit me true to size. I have long arms and a long torso and the arms are long enough as is the waist. I can wear this with leggings and feel comfortable. Very soft and did not shrink in the dryer.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">9</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">An Off-The-Shoulder Tunic For Nights Out</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>dressy tunic</a> is perfect for date nights, cocktail parties, and evenings out with friends. It has an off-the-shoulder fit and cool twist detail, and it can be worn with everything from leather leggings to tapered blue jeans.

Endlessly versatile for any season, it's made of a comfy, slightly stretchy blend of rayon and spandex.

Very lightweight but not too see through. I ended up wearing this as a summer outfit with shorts and a tank, tied at the waist. It does wrinkle quite easily. Started with army green and white but definitely buy again in other colors.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">11</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Linen Tunic/Dress With The Roomiest Pockets</h2></p><p>Whether you wear it as a top with leggings or on its own as a dress, you'll appreciate the functionality of this <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tunic's</a> deep, roomy pockets.

Impressively, it has over 3,000 five-star ratings on Amazon thus far.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors/prints: 24</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “It is roomy, the material is soft, and the way the shirt falls with the knot makes it very flattering.

The quality of the fabric is fantastic! Makes a great piece for layering because it's not too thick, but can be worn alone because it's not too thin. [...] Great length for leggings, but definitely also works well with skinny jeans. I love the small slit along the side. This is not a high-low design, which I love in order to have the length in the front. Gradually purchasing additional colors!”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">17</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Soft & Stretchy Tunic With A Tight Fit & Ruched Sides</h2></p><p>Ruched sides and a tight fit give this <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tunic</a> a slightly sultry touch — it’ll look great with leggings and knee-high boots, like in the picture, though it can also be dressed down with white sneakers and skinny jeans.

It hugs the lower part of your arms which I love and [is] loose on the rest of me. I plan to buy in other colors due to the versatility of the top.
