Though rumors began circulating that Irish actor <strong>Jamie Dornan</strong> was planning on exiting the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise, his rep confirmed that, if and when a sequel is announced, he will reprise his role as billionaire Christian Grey.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jamie is delighted that the film is breaking box office records worldwide and whilst the studio has not made any formal announcements about sequels, he is looking forward to making the next film," his rep told Us Weekly.</p><p>The franchise’s first installment has already brought in more than $400 million worldwide, so a sequel seems inevitable. Author <strong>E L James</strong>, who penned the best-selling erotic novels, wrote two other books in the trilogy — Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the first film’s release, there were rumors that Dornan’s wife <strong>Amelia Warner</strong> was uncomfortable with the film’s raunchy sex scenes, which would cause him to back out of future movies. But clearly those were false.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans might not be excited by Dornan’s announcement. The majority of the film’s negative reviews — while giving praise to star <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong> — surround his performance as the S&M-happy billionaire. Dornan was initially the second choice for the role after Sons of Anarchy star <strong>Charlie Hunnam</strong> turned down the part.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Are you glad Jamie Dornan will return as Christian Grey?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOo5imoZVisbC%2BzZqlZpufo7OqvsysZJygop7AtbXAp2SgqpWuenZ8jKyfmpyVqHq0sdCunKVlYmV%2Bdn6Uaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-byrne-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>David Byrne Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
