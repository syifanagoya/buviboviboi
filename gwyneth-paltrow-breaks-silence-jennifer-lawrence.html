The actress quashed reports that she doesn’t approve of her <a class=hm-link href=#>ex-husband's girlfriend</a> as she sat down for an interview on Howard Stern’s radio show on Wednesday. "<strong>Who says I don't approve of Jennifer Lawrence?</strong>" the 42-year-old actress said. "I respect him as the father of my children… It's his decision…<strong>He wouldn't be with someone who isn't great.</strong>"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3a1fb8f692e8-gwyneth-paltrow-z.jpg><p id=erEoyJH6sz4g data-wc=150>Almost a year on from their split, Gwyneth said she was doing "well" and continued to praise the Coldplay frontman. "<strong>He's lovely</strong>," she said. "<strong>He's such a sweetheart</strong>. We actually have a <strong>really strong friendship</strong>, and we laugh and we have fun." The mum-of-two continued, "There are <strong>times when it's really difficult</strong>, and things happen, and I'm sure he doesn't want to hang out with me, and I don't want to hang out with him, but for the sake of the kids you do it, but you also don't do it all tense." Explaining the method behind their <a class=hm-link href=#>'conscious uncoupling'</a>, Gwyneth said, "You say, 'I really want to find my love for you, and I want to forgive you and I want you to forgive me, and let's have some fun as a family.' Because, you know, <strong>he's going to be in my life for the rest of my life</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d4e2e19d92d-gwyneth-chris-z.jpg><p id=e3RUy71OcAQ9 data-wc=130>It was especially important to the couple that they maintained a healthy relationship for the sake of their children, <strong>Apple</strong>, 10, and <strong>Moses</strong>, eight. "When I was talking to friends of mine who had grown up and their parents were divorced, there was a common thread which was, 'Oh yeah, now my parents are great and they were both at my wedding… but there was five years where they didn't talk', or 'There were seven years were they wouldn't be in the same room.'" Gwyneth said. "And I was like, 'Can we just skip to that?' Because <strong>I don't want to do that to my kids</strong>." She added, "<strong>We're lucky in that our parenting styles and philosophies overlap a lot</strong>. We see eye to eye on how to do it."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
