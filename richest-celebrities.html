I realized it was just prolonging the inevitable of dealing with them… I thought that by doing drugs it would buy me time to feeling better. And when that wasn't working, I just realized I was in this other cycle, and that I was creating it myself. And I realized I needed to cut all the darkness out of my life."</p><p>In March 2021, King revealed that after two miscarriages due to polycystic ovary syndrome, she was expecting a baby with tattoo artist Dan Tooker, who she had been engaged to since October 2020.
