Despite her age, she has maintained her appearance exceptionally well. In addition, she is of medium build.&nbsp;</p><p>The radiant actress is quite petite. She stands tall at the height of 5 feet and 3 inches. Moreover, My has brown eyes and dark brown hair.</p><p>My was born in Kalmar, Kalmar län, Sweden. Hence, she is a Swedish national.&nbsp;</p><p>She belongs to the Swedes ethnicity. Likewise, when it comes to her religion, My is an atheist.&nbsp;</p><p>My and her ex-husband, Stellan Skarsgård, brought up their children in a non-religious household.

The actor began reading the Bible and the Quran after the 9/11 attacks. He, however, found both religious texts to be violent.</p><p>In an interview with The Guardian, Skarsgård openly criticized religion and said,</p><p>“So everybody who is religious has God on his side, which is terribly dangerous. And nobody should be sure they have God on their side.”&nbsp;</p><p>My is not just a talented actress but also a well-educated woman.

Even before they formally met each other for the first time, Stellan and she had known each other since they grew up in the same neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after their first meeting, they fell in love and dated each other for a year. On April 27, 1975, the pair cemented their relationship and exchanged wedding vows. Sometime after their wedding, the happy couple decided to expand their family.&nbsp;</p><p>My and Stellan had always wanted a big family.

The actor said,</p><p>“She knows I’m sober. They know – everyone around me. I’ve seen alcoholism up close and it is not pretty. I was 18 when she got cancer, which then triggered alcoholism, and had to take a lot of responsibility for my younger siblings. I do not want to become the person I saw my mother become then. But she’s a svingrym person now.”</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_b54718-56 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_b54718-56>Career</h2><p>My earned her medical degree in 1978 and started working as a licensed physician.
