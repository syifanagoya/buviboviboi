The band had just enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame, with their debut album “Business as Usual” becoming a massive commercial success. However, the band struggled with the intense scrutiny and pressure that came with their newfound success. Hay, in particular, found it difficult to cope with the constant demands of touring and performing.</p><p>In an interview with SongFacts, Hay revealed that the song was inspired by his experiences with anxiety and panic attacks. “I was having these anxiety attacks, and I didn’t know what they were,” he said. “I just thought I was freaking out. And it wouldn’t go away. It was always there.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics></span>The Lyrics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lyrics of “Overkill” are deeply personal and introspective, reflecting Hay’s struggles with anxiety and the demands of the music industry. The song begins with the lines, “I can’t get to sleep / I think about the implications / Of diving in too deep / And possibly the complications.” These lines convey a sense of anxiety and apprehension, as Hay grapples with the consequences of his actions.</p><p>The chorus of the song is particularly evocative, with Hay singing, “I can’t get to sleep / I think about the implications / Of falling in too deep / And possibly the complications / Especially at night / I worry over situations / I know will be all right / Perhaps it’s just imagination.” These lines reflect the sense of isolation and overwhelm that Hay feels, as he struggles to navigate his way through the pressures of his career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Music_Video></span>The Music Video<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The music video for “Overkill” is a surreal and dreamlike depiction of the song’s themes. Directed by Russell Mulcahy, the video shows a sleepwalking Hay wandering through a futuristic cityscape, as he grapples with his anxieties and fears.</p><p>The video reflects the sense of disconnect and isolation that Hay felt during this time, as he struggled with the demands of his career. The futuristic cityscape is a metaphor for the relentless pace of the music industry, as Hay tries desperately to keep up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy_of_%E2%80%9COverkill%E2%80%9D></span>The Legacy of “Overkill”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Overkill” remains one of Men at Work’s most enduring songs, and has resonated with fans all over the world.

And that’s a really satisfying thing.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Importance_of_%E2%80%9COverkill%E2%80%9D></span>The Importance of “Overkill”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Overkill” remains an important reminder of the toll that success can take on individuals and the importance of acknowledging one’s mental health. The song’s themes of anxiety and isolation are all too common in the music industry, and its message continues to resonate with musicians and fans alike.</p><p>As Hay himself said, “I think it’s important to be aware of the fact that people can struggle with mental health issues, and it’s okay to talk about it.
