Until the age of 18, he had spent his whole life in London. His specific date of birth is unknown, but going by his year of birth, he is in the same age bracket as his wife, Candace.</p><h2><strong><span>Who is George Farmer’s Father?</span></strong></h2><p>George Farmer’s father is Lord Michael Farmer, a&nbsp;British businessman, former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and philanthropist. He is a well-known self-made commodities tycoon and former Tory party treasurer. He grew up in the slums of London and worked as an account clerk to cater for his family.</p><p>Through his hard work, he provided a solid start in life for his family from his skills as a commodities dealer. Consequently, George was raised in a politically active household with a diverse set of ideas and beliefs. As a result of his upbringing, he developed an early interest in politics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/pjimage.jpg><h2><span><strong>Education and Qualifications</strong></span></h2><p>Growing up, George attended the prestigious St. Paul’s private school in London for his primary education. Later on, he enrolled at Oxford University and bagged a degree in theology. Some reports also have it that he earned a degree in business management from Oxford. While in school, he was a member of numerous political organizations and was also quite active in them.</p><table><tbody readability=4><tr><td><strong>Schools Attended</strong></td><td><strong>Qualifications</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>St. Paul’s School, London</td><td>High School</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Oxford University Oxfordshire, London</td><td>First Class Degree in Theology</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>He Grew Up To Become An Astute Businessman Like His Father</strong></h2><p>George worked for an investment bank in London for eighteen months after graduating from Oxford University. However, since 2012, he has been trading base metals alongside his father in the commodity business, and they have been remarkably successful in doing so. His firm “Red Kite Group” is in charge of the copper market through which he has made millions in the metal industry.</p><p>They expanded the company into a hedge fund business as it progressed, focusing on mine investments and finance. Though George is often taken to be the main owner of the business, it is not entirely his as he founded the company with a group of partners. Obviously, he/they assembled the best heads in the industry to run the company as it has been remarkably successful.</p><p>Apart from his businesses in metal mining and finance, George Farmer has also held leadership positions in many other organizations. Some of these include his time as the chairman of Turning Point UK and when he was a member of the Bullingdon Club, an elite all-male dining club. Currently, Farmer is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the social media app Parler. He was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>announced as the new CEO</a> and successor of Mark Meckler. Before his new appointment, Geroge served as Parler’s Operating Chief and equally has a wealth of over 10 years of experience in the finance sector.</p><h2><span><strong>What is George Farmer’s Net Worth?</strong></span></h2><p>George Farmer has a net worth of $180 million. He comes from a wealthy family; hence, his inheritance contributed a huge chunk of his net worth. The other chunk comes from his stock portfolio, real estate investments, and other businesses he owns and runs.</p><h2><span><strong>How and When Did George and Candace Meet?</strong></span></h2><p>George Farmer met his now-wife, Candace Owens, in December 2018 at a soft launch event for Turning Point UK. Candace was the addressee at the gathering, and Farmer was intimidated by how she presented herself.</p><p>Following that, Farmer approached her and struck up a discussion with her, and it went well between the duo. The two of them went on a dinner date the next day, and that’s how and when it all began. They connected well since they held similar political ideas and humor.</p><h2><strong>George Thomas Farmer Married Candace Owens In 2018</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Candace-Owens-and-Her-husband-George-Farmer-.jpg><p>Before committing to marriage, Farmer and Owens didn’t feel a lengthy relationship was necessary since they both knew they were destined to be together forever. Within three weeks of meeting one other, the pair were engaged, and about 8 months later, they got married in a unique way.</p><p>They married twice because Candace always wanted a modest wedding with all of her close friends and family, so they had a ceremony with them. Following that, they hosted an extravagant ceremony on August 19, 2019. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>George and Candace got married</a> at Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, an occasion to which top delegates were invited.</p><h2><span><strong>How Many Children does Candace Owen have With George Farmer?</strong></span></h2><p>George Thomas Farmer and Candace Owens have one child together. Their son was born in January 2021. Following the birth of their tot, fellow influential and controversial conservative figures in America’s political landscape like Megyn Kelly and Lara Trump all sent in their congratulatory messages to the new parents.</p><p>For now, not much has been revealed about George and Candance’s child, and we rarely see snaps of him on social media. On the other hand, while Candace is active on social media, George Farmer is not, although his photographs are visible online.</p><h2><strong>George Farmer Shares His Wife’s Conservative Political Views</strong></h2><p>Candace Owens is a conservative political activist who is frequently in the news for her controversial opinions. George and his wife share similar political ideas. Owens is a right-wing American who believes that black people should vote for Republicans instead of Democrats. On the other hand, George is a vehement opponent of the European Union and an outspoken conservative.</p><p>George Farmer has spared no effort in order to establish a name in conservative politics. In 2016, he was the youngest member of the Leader’s Group to donate a minimum of £50,000 per year to get exclusive access to the Prime Minister. In 2018, he chaired the Tories’ lavish Black and White Ball for conservatives. He was once the chairman of Turning Point UK, an offshoot of Turning Point USA championed by Candace Owens (Owens was once Turning Point USA Communications director).</p><p>George and Candace do share a lot in common as they seek to support the right. While she advocates for Brexit – for conservative African-Americans, and George is an avid supporter of Brexit – for Great Britain to leave the European Union. He is a genuine skeptic of the European Union, calling it “a toxic, socialist, genocidal superstate.” Candance Owens and George Farmer’s support for Donald Trump is undeniable as George once described him as “a bombastic but effective disruptor.”</p><h2><strong>Controversies Owens Has Dragged George Into</strong></h2><p>Candace Owens Farmer has made several statements that have sparked public outrage, although she has followers who appreciate her social and political critiques. There have been some instances where her husband has been dragged into some of her controversies, and some of them include;</p><h4><strong>Her Tweet Spat with Cardi B</strong></h4><p>On The Ben Shapiro Show, Owens criticized Cardi’s interview with Joe Biden, igniting a Twitter war with the rapper. Cardi had shared a video of her sister Hennessy Carolina and her partner being attacked by Trump fans “because they are an Afro/Hispanic lesbian couple,” and the two spat barbs on Twitter all night. In reaction to Owens’ part on The Ben Shapiro Show, the “WAP” rapper elaborated by saying, “No matter how much money I make, no matter how hard I work, I can’t be a f—ing free American. My sister can’t be a f—ing free American. You got this f—ing Trump-supporting family harassing two lesbians. The f—?”.</p><p>Cardi B made some claims about George Farmer not too long after, which got him a significant media glare. Cardi B alleged in her statement that George was having an affair with Candace’s brother. On the other hand, Candace has vowed to sue her over the claims leveled against her husband and brother. Their Twitter spat garnered a lot of attention from the media.</p><h4><strong>Owens’ Remark on Masculinity with Harry Styles</strong></h4><p>Owens and Styles made <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>their disagreement about masculinity</a> public when the pop singer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>posted a snap</a> of his December 2020 Vogue cover shoot with the tagline “Bring back manly men,” which appeared to be a swipe at Owens. In the shot, Styles is wearing a gown, which some found adorable while others lambasted as symbolizing the demise of “rugged masculinity.”</p><p>On Twitter, Owen replied to Styles’ remark. She added with an image of Styles’ Instagram snap, “When people attempt to tell me I don’t have influence, and then @Harry Styles dedicates a whole post to my tweet.” “I am a catalyst for global dialogue. #BringBackManlyMen. Shots have been fired.” The conversation that ensued led to many people questioning the masculinity of her husband, George Farmer, or perhaps if there is something between the couple the media haven’t reported yet.</p><p>These are some of the instances where the controversial couple has been dragged into controversies, especially in the media. Despite all these, the couple appears to be united against all odds, at least in the eyes of the public.</p><h2><span><strong>FAQs</strong></span></h2><h3><span><strong>Who is George Farmer?</strong></span></h3><p>George Farmer is the husband of controversial American right-wing activist Candace Owens.
