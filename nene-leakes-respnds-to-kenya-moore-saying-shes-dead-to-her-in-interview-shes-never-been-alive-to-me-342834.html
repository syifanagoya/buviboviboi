So many people have speculated and said so many things. I even heard some of my fellow Housewives… ‘Oh, she was suspended.’ I’m like, ‘Was I? Please call Andy Cohen. Okay, because people get things misconstrued, I grabbed the camera guy’s shirt. He didn’t have a problem with it — I don’t know why anyone else does. I’ve been into a lot of things on this show and if I was going to get suspended, it sure wouldn’t have been for pulling that shirt… There have been physical altercations on our show and they weren’t suspended.’</p><p></p><p>Nene also went on to say that fans will be seeing a different side to her this season compared to any other installment of RHOA. Her husband, Gregg Leakes, was diagnosed with and beat cancer.</p><p>The sickness really changed the dynamic of their relationship and it will be something that will be explored throughout the season.</p><p>‘Listen, I have learned patience in a whole new way… A lot of things that people say doesn’t really bother me… The girls are saying certain things or they didn’t like what I said… I’m gonna say whatever I want to say ’cause they say whatever they want to say.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2K%2Fpr%2FPp5usZaSkeqyxzbKYZqWfpL%2BmedKasKKml2LAqbHSZpuemZRiwbB5x56pZqGeYravwMSrraKdp2LAqbHSZqWerpWneqOxxKdkmqSZq7JuwM5mpJ5lY2l%2FeX%2BTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dauood-naimyar-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Dauood Naimyar Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</span></a>
