His father, Tony Parker Sr., was a professional basketball player who played for many foreign clubs overseas.</p><p>Even though Tony Sr. was an American citizen, his family lived in France and played professional basketball.</p><p>However, Tony’s mother, Pamela Firestone, was a Dutch citizen and a Dutch national tennis champion (1956).</p><p>Tony started enjoying sports from a very young age. He and his younger brothers often went to watch their father play basketball. However, he was initially interested in soccer.</p><p>Moreover, his two brothers, T.J. and Pierre, were equally good sportsmen, and the three brothers later followed in their father’s footsteps.</p><p>As their family already had many renowned athletes in the past, his parents were very supportive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Young-Tony-Parker-right-with-his-parents-and-siblings.jpg><p>Consequently, both his brothers and he became successful professional basketball players.</p><p>T.J. even became a part of the French national team in numerous tournaments and now is the head coach at ASVEL.&nbsp;</p><p>While still at school, Tony gradually shifted his focus towards basketball from soccer. However, <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>‘s rise and popularity at that time had left a deep impression on him, and as a result, he became highly involved in the sport.</p><p>While he was 15, his family received the naturalized citizenship of France, and soon after, he received an offer to enroll in the elite sports learning institute, INSEP, in Paris.</p><p>After taking admission at INSEP, he did not pursue academic education.</p><h2>Tony Parker | Career</h2><h3>Professional Career</h3><h4>French League</h4><p>While he was still a student at INSEP, Parker played in the amateur league in Paris for two seasons.</p><p>Then, he signed with the famous French club Paris Basket Racing to play in the LNB Pro A after his graduation.</p><p>The player soon received wider recognition for his performance in the first season of the French League.</p><p>Consequently, in 2000, Tony received an invitation to play in the Nike Hoop Summit held in Indianapolis, USA.</p><p>Even though the event was full of top-class athletes from Europe and the USA, he did not hesitate to show his natural game and outshone almost everyone in the tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his success, many universities in the USA offered him scholarships, but he refused.

After going through two rounds of strict tests, Tony eventually impressed the Spurs.</p><p>Consequently, the Spurs picked him as the 2001 NBA draft’s first-round 28th pick.</p><p>As the club already had an experienced point guard <a href=#>Antonio Daniels</a>, he mostly played as a backup in his rookie season.</p><p>Moving on to the next season, Tony took on as the team’s key point guard, and thus, he gained more playtime.
