"A series of recent events have made it clear to me that Kate Gosselin and her contributions do not align with the authenticity which we set out to build almost a decade ago, and that Ms. Gosselin is simply not a good fit with the wonderful team and culture at CouponCabin."</p><p>Concluded Kluth, "We wish Kate, her family and her support staff all the best."</p><p>Beyond the CEO's letter, CouponCabin has declined to elaborate on the "recent events" that led them to fire the 37-year-old Philadelphia native, who is a mom to twins <strong>Cara</strong> and <strong>Madelyn</strong>, 12, and sextuplets <strong>Aaden</strong>, <strong>Collin</strong>, <strong>Joel</strong>, <strong>Leah</strong>,<strong> Alexis</strong> and <strong>Hannah</strong>, 8, with ex-husband <strong>Jon Gosselin</strong>.</p><p>Since TLC's Kate Plus 8 went off the air in 2011, Gosselin has focused on her kids and her blog, in which she shared budgeting tips with CouponCabin's readers.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last week, however, the mom of eight appeared on Watch What Happens Live, <a href=#>where she addressed her youthful appearance and those reports that she's dating her bodyguard</a>.</p><p>"I am probably one of the rare few who de-age," Gosselin told <strong>Andy Cohen</strong>, shooting down speculation that she's had work done.</p><p>As for her bond with her longtime bodyguard <strong>Steve Neild</strong>? "I'm single! Still [and] always," she exclaimed, denying longstanding rumors of a romance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdm7azscNmnaunnWKwsMHPqKWcmZKeu26uy6ieoKGenHqru8FmaWlpYmaDcnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josiah-graham.html><span>←</span><span>Josiah Graham</span></a>
