It has an all-star cast and a plot that is based on real events.</strong></p><p>Fans have been waiting for more episodes since the first two came out on the day the show started.</p><p>But how many episodes does Black Bird have? When does it come out? And what are the chances that there will be a second season?</p><h2>BLACK BIRD RELEASE DATE AND PLOT PREVIEW</h2><p>On Friday, July 8, 2022, Black Bird flew onto Apple TV</p><p>Based on real events, Black Bird is the story of James Keene, a former high school football star and the son of a decorated police officer who is sentenced to ten years in a minimum-security prison.</p><p>Keene is given the chance of a lifetime when he is offered his freedom in exchange for going to a maximum-security prison for criminally insane people to befriend suspected serial killer Larry Hall and find out where the bodies of several young girls are buried.</p><p>But Keene’s job isn’t easy because it’s not clear if Hall’s answers are true or just more lies from a habitual liar.</p><h2>HOW MANY EPISODES ARE IN BLACK BIRD?</h2><p>The whole season of Black Bird will have six episodes.</p><p>After the first two episodes came out on July 8, the rest of the series will come out every Friday.</p><p>After the first two episodes, there are still four more, so fans can expect Black Bird to air every week until August 5.</p><p>Here are the titles and release dates for the rest of Black Bird’s episodes:</p><h2>WON’T THERE BE A SECOND SEASON?</h2><p>No, there won’t be a second season of Black Bird on Apple TV+.</p><p>This is because the drama is called a “limited mini-series,” which means that its story is told in just one season.</p><p>Black Bird is a limited series because it is based on real events. The real James Keene wrote about these events in his 2010 autobiography, In With the Devil: A Fallen Hero, a Serial Killer, and a Dangerous Bargain for Redemption.</p><p>The book, like the show, is about Keene’s time in prison, but there is no sequel to the book, so there couldn’t be a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGifqK9doq6vxYyep6Krn5mytHnAq5xmoZ5ir62twqRkm6GimXqivM%2BlnGaspmLApLTEnaylnV2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adelaide-woolworths-customers-lose-it-over-awkward-valentines-day-sign.html><span>←</span><span>Adelaide Woolworths customers lose it over awkward Valentines Day sign</span></a>
