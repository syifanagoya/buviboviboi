If you're a natural like me, then you already know the drop in temperature wreaks nothing but havoc on our hair, leaving it feeling dry and brittle. So to prevent any subsequent breakage, I always make sure to have my hair tucked away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the truth is that not all protective styles are ideal for fall. Traditional box braids, for example, may not last as long during this time, seeing as any friction from beanies or other hats can create unwanted frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, there are still plenty of styles to choose from that are ideal for fall — and the great news is that no matter which ones you decide to go with, they each look great on everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Click through to see some of the best protective styles to try out for fall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>This is </i><i>All Natural</i>.<i> From the kinkiest coils to loose waves, we're celebrating natural hair in its many forms by sharing expert tips for styling, maintenance, and haircare.</i></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faux-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Faux Locs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Faux locs look great year-round, but I especially love them for fall. This style requires the braiding extensions to be wrapped around your natural hair, leaving it completely protected from harsh, cold temperatures that can cause dryness and breakage. Plus, there are also so many fun ways to wear this style. Model and Real Housewives of Atlanta star Eva Marcille opted to rock multi-toned blonde locs, adorned with various hair rings and accessories, to the 2019 BET Awards.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-straight-back-cornrows></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Straight Back Cornrows</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Crotty/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You truly cannot go wrong with cornrows. I love them for fall because if you're using your natural hair, they don't add much too much extra volume, so you can still wear all your favorite autumn hats. Straight backs are also simple to create, go with just about any look — whether formal or casual — and can easily be styled into a cute ponytail or a bun. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tracee Ellis Ross</a> opted for the latter when she attended the Annual Nominees Night for the 2018 Emmys.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marley-twists></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Marley Twists</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Leon Bennett/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much like faux locs, Marley twists look even better once they've gained a little frizz. But while they don't completely cover the natural hair, this style is ultra lightweight, allowing for tons of flexibility with zero tension that could lead to possible breakage. Brandy wore these twists to the 27th annual NAACP Theatre Awards in 2018.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Knotless Braids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knotless braids have become just as (if not more) popular than traditional box braids, and for good reason. This style requires plaiting your own hair at the base, rather than creating a knot with the extensions at the root, making this a more natural-looking option, whether you use human or synthetic hair. The knotless aspect also creates much less volume at the roots, so you can still comfortably wear all your favorite hoodies, beanies, and fall hats throughout the season. That said, since this is a more natural look, these braids will still look impeccable even if they're a bit grown out or have gained a little frizz from hat friction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rihanna wore beautiful, large dark red knotless braids to her Fenty x Webster Cocktail Pop-up in 2019 — a perfect color for fall.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-distressed-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Distressed Braids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alo Ceballos/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to take the natural-looking, knotless style to the next level, distressed braids may be exactly what you're looking for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For this style, the roots are braided, while the ends are left out, which makes human hair extensions most ideal to use to achieve the look. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zoë Kravitz</a> has long worn her hair like this, which inspired independent braider <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Boho Babe</a> to create her own version of the plaits that are perfect for autumn.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cornrows-and-single-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cornrows and Single Braids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you love single braids, but hate having hair in your face, this two-in-one look is the perfect go-to style. You can finish off with sleek, tradition box braids, or the distressed look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-passion-twists></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Passion Twists</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much like Marley twists, passion twists are light as air, so you won't experience any tension or tugging while you have this style in. The best part is that since these twists have an undone finish, a little frizz from sweaters or hats won't make them look worn out. Plus, the textured finish also allows you to style your hair into a number of unique and versatile looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eSmsC1ec%2Brpq2dk6m2t7GMoZiiqqOpxq2x0madqKpdm66tuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kimmy-granger-height.html><span>←</span><span>Kimmy Granger- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
