Identifying herself as a BLM activist, Bryant showcases her initiatives through a unique website.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Quinn Gallagher: Lauren Boebert’s ‘mystery man’ is a Democrat who owns a Colorado bar</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="University of Virginia Student Zyahna Bryant" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/University-of-Virginia-Student-Zyahna-Bryant.webp alt="University of Virginia Student Zyahna Bryant" width=400 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, in 2020, she garnered attention by falsely accusing Morgan Bettinger of derogatory comments towards BLM protestors, claiming Bettinger referred to them as “Speed Bumps.”</p><p>As a result, the student-run judiciary committee pressured Bettinger into apologizing to Bryant and engaging in social justice-related community service to graduate.</p><p>Subsequently, Zyahna acknowledged the possibility of mishearing, but the harm had already been inflicted upon the innocent Morgan Bettinger. Recent news has again highlighted Zyahna due to her collaboration with the beauty brand Dove.</p><p>This collaboration has sparked outrage as Dove’s association with Zyahna is seen as an endorsement of someone who unjustly targeted Morgan Bettinger based on her white ethnicity, causing significant distress in Bettinger’s life.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Zyahna Bryant and Morgan Bettinger controversy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Zyahna-Bryant-and-Morgan-Bettinger-controversy.webp alt="Zyahna Bryant and Morgan Bettinger controversy" width=400 height=253 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Zyahna Destroyed Morgan Bettinger’s Life</strong></h2><p>In July 2020, amidst the George Floyd protests, Bettinger inadvertently found herself on a street where protesters had gathered. Believing the road was open to traffic, she parked her car to investigate the situation. While passing by, she engaged in a brief conversation with a truck driver who was present.</p><p>According to Bettinger, during this conversation, she mentioned to the truck driver that his presence was beneficial to ensure the safety of the protesters. However, Bryant overheard part of this conversation and tweeted that Bettinger had referred to the protesters as potentially becoming ‘good speedbumps.’</p><p>This misrepresentation was an attempt by Bryant to gain popularity by distorting words and defaming Bettinger based on her race. Bryant even went to the extent of trying to have Bettinger removed from the university. However, the situation turned when the truck driver clarified to the police that Zyahna had misrepresented the conversation.</p><p>Bryant changed her stance to manage the fallout, acknowledging a possible mishearing. Individuals like Bryant, who manipulate words and situations for personal gain, should not be entrusted with leading protests or participating in activism.</p><p>However, unfortunately, there remain some supporters of her divisive ideology, highlighting a concerning aspect of current realities.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Dove hired Zyahna to promote fat liberation" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dove-hired-Zyahna-to-promote-fat-liberation.webp alt="Dove hired Zyahna to promote fat liberation" width=450 height=302 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Dove Walking on the Lines of Bud Light</strong></h2><p>Dove recently revealed a collaboration with Zyahna Bryant, a prominent BLM activist known for accusing a white student of threatening protesters, though she later acknowledged a possible misunderstanding.</p><p>This collaboration led to widespread calls for a boycott of Dove products, drawing parallels to the controversy surrounding Bud Light’s engagement with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney.</p><p>Outraged conservatives initiated a boycott of Dove, criticizing the soap brand for aligning with a Black Lives Matter activist who had negatively impacted a white student’s life based on a remark she later conceded she might have ‘misheard.’</p><p>Many women took to Twitter, sharing images of Dove soap discarded in protest, expressing their discontent.</p><p>Notably, Dove strives to combat “body size discrimination” in the United States, advocating its criminalization in all 50 states.</p><p>The brand clarified in its partnership announcement that the joint effort with Zyahna Bryant centers around education and advocacy, aiming to eliminate bias from society.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Zyahna Bryant childhood photo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Zyahna-Bryant-childhood-photo.webp alt="Zyahna Bryant childhood photo" width=400 height=526 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Zyahna Bryant’s Parents and Background</strong></h2><p>On November 24,&nbsp; 2001, Zyahna Bryant (age 22) was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, America. Raised by her single mother, Zeneida Howard, she shares her upbringing with two siblings. A spotlight marked Zyahna’s early years on her struggle with weight.</p><p>In 2008, her mother highlighted the challenges they faced in addressing her weight issues through a news article. The public eye continued to follow her journey. By the time she was 12, Zyahna had organized her first rally advocating for justice in the tragic case of Trayvon Martin, a victim of police violence.</p><p><img decoding=async title="BLM Activist Zyahna Bryant" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BLM-Activist-Zyahna-Bryant.webp alt="BLM Activist Zyahna Bryant" width=400 height=493 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Bryant Became the Face of BLM Protests</strong></h2><p>In 2015, Zyahna made her mark as a panelist, joining local organizers and Bernie Sanders at a Town Hall in Charlottesville. The discussion revolved around the importance of funding public education and grants.</p><p>She further solidified her role as a community leader by founding and chairing the Black Student Union, actively pushing for removing the Lee Statue and renaming the park formerly known as Lee Park. Her efforts culminated in success when 2017, the Charlottesville City Council voted to remove the statues.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Zyahna Bryant" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Zyahna-Bryant-weight.webp alt="Zyahna Bryant weight" width=400 height=544 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Zyahna has maintained her dedication to fostering change, continually collaborating with local teens and youth leaders to address racial disparities, particularly in the education sector. Gradually, she emerged as a prominent figure within the BLM movement.</p><p>In January 2019, Zyahna showcased her literary talents by publishing “Reclaim,” a collection of poetry and essays.</p><p>Currently, she holds the distinction of being the youngest member of the inaugural Virginia African American Advisory Board, having been appointed by Governor Ralph Northam.</p><p>Her focus within this role remains on rectifying educational disparities and ensuring equitable access for youth of color.
