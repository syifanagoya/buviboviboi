be the Grand Clock Puzzle or what others simply refer to as the Clock Puzzle.</span></p><h2><b>How To Solve Ashley Clock Puzzle?</b><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RE4ACLPU-2.png alt="Hastily Written Note with a description" width=624 height=351 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p><span>While exploring what appears to be a library section, you will come across a hastily written note that has a time written as 11:04 and the word clock on it.</span></p><p><span>The Clock Puzzle Professional Hastily Written Note will have a different description, which is “</span><span>VIIXII” or 7:00 written on it as a clue.</span></p><p><span>By reading this, it looks like the time written down has something to do with a clock </span><span>or the clock time</span><span>, which is most likely the Grandfather Clock.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RE4ACLPU-3.png alt="A note near the Grandfather Clock" width=624 height=351 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>A note that you find near the Grandfather Clock mentions that “The resting forebears answer to the chosen time” with the words chosen time being green.</span></p><p><span>If it was not already obvious, you need to set the time on the Grand Clock to whatever is written on the Hastily Written Note.</span></p><p><span>This can be done by interacting with the Grand Clock and rotating the hands to set the time to what is on the note that you have found.</span></p><h2><b>Ashley Clock Puzzle Solution</b><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RE4ACLPU-4.png alt="Ashley solves the clock puzzle by setting the correct time in the clock" width=624 height=351 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p><span>Now that you have the time that is needed after reading the Hastily Written Note, you will now need to set the time to match it.</span></p><p><span>On Assisted and Standard, you will need to rotate the clock hands and set it to 11:04 but on Professional difficulty, it needs to be set to 7:00.</span></p><p><span>This will solve the puzzle, causing the Grandfather Clock to reveal a door that opens up, which allows Ashley to proceed.</span></p><h2><b>Verdict</b></h2><p><span>With the Grandfather Clock Puzzle solved, Ashley can now make her way through the area and can continue searching for a way to save Leon.</span></p><p><span>This won’t be the first puzzle she has to solve though as another puzzle called <span><a href=#>the Mausoleum Puzzle</a></span> will also need to be completed.</span></p><p><span>It’s a good thing Leon helped her find her courage because she’s going to need it since she is not alone in the area and danger lurks around every corner.</span></p><p
